# eDNA-VAI-Pipeline
An AI-driven pipeline for deep-sea biodiversity assessment. It uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform unsupervised clustering of eDNA sequences, enabling the discovery of novel taxa without relying on incomplete, outdated reference databases. A real-world solution for CMLRE.
